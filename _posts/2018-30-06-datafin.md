# DataFin, experimentation on the open data of the french public finance

As part of the open data framework encouraged in the public services, (datafin)[https://datafin.fr/], we experimented with the folium python library to display adminstrative information about public buildings near Strasbourg.

The small example that we developped during this afternoon is (available here)[https://straymat.github.io/assets/datafin.html]
